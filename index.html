        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I started my journey with Computer Science in high school when over the summer of my freshman year I took an intro class.
          We learned some Python and messed around with turtles. I wouldn't say I learned much, but that was all it took to get me hooked.
          After highschool as my mission (for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) was nearing its end I thought a lot about 
          what I wanted to study in school. Computer Science came to my mind repeatedly as what I should do.
          I love that I can create the same project as someone else, yet our code could be vastly different. 
          There is no right or wrong way to make a program (though there are better and worse ways) and that has so much appeal to me.
          I feel like Computer Science is a giant puzzle where I have all the pieces I need, I only need to figure out how to put them together
          in such a way that my code does what I want. I love coding and as I work on my projects I seem to lose all track of time. 
          I love to create and build and watch the things I make come to life, and Computer Science is a beautiful outlet for that. 
          I am currently building a Java server with an Android app, as well as using AWS to host my website I'm creating using React.js
          and a REST API. I would love to get more experience with software development in a team environment and begin my journey to become 
          a Software Engineer. Visit my GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/KyerHarris">https://github.com/KyerHarris</a
